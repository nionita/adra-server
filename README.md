# ADRA smart card server

This is a simple smart card server, used locally to quickly identify people
in a web application of the ADRA organization (Mistelbach, Austria).

The server is installed and started on the client PCs independent of the
web application server. The Javascript running in the browser must be
robust in respect to errors which may occur because the adra-server is not
installed or not started.
